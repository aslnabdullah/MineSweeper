# MINESWEEPER GAME 

## I want to talk about my game briefly. 

- First, the user will enter the desired size in the game table.

- Then the table with the locations of the mines will be displayed first.

- The user will enter the desired row and column.

- If there are mines at the coordinates entered by the user, the game ends.

- If there are no mines, the number of mines around the entered coordinate will be shown in the entered coordinate.

- If all mine-free points are opened, the game ends successfully.
